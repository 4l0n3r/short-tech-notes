trusted setup:
    1. creation of secret
    2. create proof using the secret
    3. destroy the secret
    4. give the proof to verifier

Core Pillars
    1. Completeness - Ensuring Honest Provers Succeed
    2. Soundness - Preventing Dishonest Provers from Cheating
    3. Zero-Knowledge - nothing to be leaked to prover

Process
    Step 1 (Front-End): Arithmetization
    Step 2 (Front-End): Writing the Circuit
    Step 3 (Front-End): Compiling the Circuit
    Step 4 (Front-End): Generating the Witness
    Step 5 (Back-End): Proof Generation â€“ Creating Cryptographic Evidence
    Step 6 (Back-End): Verification
