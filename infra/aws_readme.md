        Dedicated Host:
            A physical server
            BYOL
        Dedicated instance:
            Instnaces on hardware
            may share hardware to other instance
            no control over the placement group
        Capacity reservation:
            reserve On-Demand instance capacity in a az
            no time commitment, no discounts
            will be charged regardless of using it or not

Placement Groups:

    Group of instances
    Cluster:
    	all in one hardware, single az
    	high bandwidth
    	high risk, speed matters

    Spread:
    	each instance in one hardware across different AZ's
    	7 instance per az
    	no risk
    	critical application, availability matters

    Partition:
    	group of instances in one partition ( one hardware )
    	7 partitions per az
    	medium risk
    	100's of instances

EC2 Hibernate:

    Hibernation:
    	Storing the current RAM data in EBS and using it while restarting the instance to save os bootup time.
    	EBS volume >> RAM < 150GB
    	Only EBS, encrypted
    	supported for few from c,m,r,t instance types
    	not more than 60 days

EC2 Instance Storage:

    EBS:
    	preserve data even after instance termination though by default Root EBS will be terminated when instance got terminated
    	network communication, bit of latency
    	only to one EC2 at a time
    	can dettach and attach it to other instance
    	bound to AZ
    	snapshot and move across region
    	move snapshots to archive tier ( 24 to 72 hours to restore )
    	Recovery rule to prevent it from accedental deletion. ( store it even if it deleted )
        snapshot fast restore -> to have faster invitial access

    	Volume Types:
    		based on size / throughput / iops
    		io1 / io2  : SSD  ( Root volume )
    		gp2 / gp3  : SSD  ( Root volume )
    		st 1  : HDD frequntly accessed
    		sc 1  : HDD infrequntly accessed

    		Only gp2/gp3 & io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes

    	Multi-Attach:
    		io1 / io2 can be attached to upto 16 instance at a time within az.

    	Encryption
    		EBS <- Encrypted -> Instance
    		unencrypted volume  -> unencrypted snapshot
    		unencrypted snapshot -> encrypted volume / unencrypted volume
    		1. copy snapshot and toggle on encryption , create volume out of it
    		2. while creating volume from unencrypted snapshot , toggle on encryption

    EFS:
    	network file system, can be mounted to many EC2
    	multi-AZ
    	only for linux based AMI's
    	too expensive ( 3x gp2 EBL )
    	inside security group
    	Encryption at rest by default
    	scales automatically
    	unpredictible workloads

    	Size: Auto scale
    	Throughput: Bursting(Auto scale based on volume), Provisioned(fixed), Elastic(Automatic)
    	Performance: General Purpose, Max IO

    	Types:
    		Standard: Frequntly use case
    		Infrequent Access ( EFS IA ): InFrequntly use case

    		based on life cycle, the files which are not accessed more than X days will move to less expensive storage( EFS IA ).

    EC2 Instance Store:
    	IO matter vaste guarante Instance Store
    	EBS is network driver, not attached directly to ec2
    	If you want high performance (faster i/o) hardware disk, use EC2 Instance store. It's directly attached to hardware.
    	data lose if hardware fails
    	use it for cache / temporary usages

    AMI:
    	customize all your configuration, OS, monitoring
    	Faster boot since all have already installed on AMI
    	bound to region, but you can copy and use it in other

    	process:
    		start instace, customize it ( em em kaavalo anni install cheseyali User data block use chesi or ssh into it and install)
    		stop instance
    		build AMI out of it
    		launch other instance using AMI

High Availability & Scalability

    Scalling:
    	Vertical
    		Increase size

    Elastic Load Balancer:
    	will forward the traffic based on instance health  ( /health : 4567 )

    	Clasic LB :
    		Http,Https,Tcp,Ssl

    	Application LB :
    		Http,Https,Websocket
    		route to different target groups (ec2,ip addresses,ecs tasks,lambda)
    		redirect

    	Network LB :
    		Tcp, Tls, Udp
            route to different target groups (ec2,ip addresses,alb)
    		million requests
            static ip for each az

    	Gateway Load Balancer :
    		Operates at layer 3
    		The traffic:
    			first will go target group of security virtual appliances
    			if the request is valid then returns to Gateway LB , then go to application
    			else, the request will be dropped off at firewall instance itself

    	public:external / private:internal LB's

    	X-Forwarded for to see the client Ip address since the application will get the request directly from load balancer instead of client.

    	Sticky Sessions:
    		The same person will always redirected to the same instance behind LB.
    		control over expiration time.
    		Cookies:
    			Application-based cookies
    				Custom cookies
    				Application cookies
    					Generated by load balancer : AWSALBAPP
    			Load-balancer cookies
    				Generated by load balancer : AWSALB , AWSELB

    	Cross Zone Load Balancer ( equal traffic to all instance across az's )
    		ALB
    			on by default
    			no charges
    			HTTP,HTTPS,WEBSOCKET
    		NLB
    			off by default
    			charges apply
    			HTTP,HTTPS,TCP
    		GLB
    			off by default
    			no charges

    	SSL/TLS certificates
    		Encrypted communication between client and lb.
    		CLB
    			one SSL for one domain
    			should create multiple CLB for multiple SSL
    		ALB , NLB
    			multiple certificates for multiple domains
    			help of SNI server name indicator

    		Server Name Indication (SNI) allows you to expose multiple HTTPS applications each with its own SSL certificate on the same listener.

    	connection draining / de-registration delay

Target Group instances unhealthy :

    404
    	change the health path
    request timed out
    	connectivity issue
        check the security groups
            lb outbound with target_sg
            target inbound with lb_sg
    less timeout configuration
    	increase the timeout

Auto Scaling group:

    The Auto Scaling Group can't go over the maximum capacity (you configured) during scale-out events.
    launch template
    cloudwatch_alarm -> asg
    Policies:
    	Dynamic policies:
    		Target tracking  : alarms created automatically and scalling happens.
    		Simple / Step : cpu utilization increases -> cloudwatch alarms triggers -> scale up 2 units
    		Scheduled : at a perticuler time
    	Predictive policies:
    		based on history -> forecast will be created -> scalling will scheduled
    metrics to scale:
    	CPUUtilization
    	RequestCountPerTarget
    	Average Network In / Out
    	Any custom metric
    cold down period ( 300 sec )
    better to use ready-to-use ami for less config time

Route53:

    create zone ( public, private )
    	create domain records inside it

    TTL

    CNAME -
    	maps hostname to another hostname
    	For Non Root domain ( something.mydomain.com )

    Alias -
    	maps hostname to Aws resource
    	For Both Root & Non_Root domains ( mydomain.com )
    	Automatically recognizes changes in the target resource IP since no TTL.
    	Always A / AAAA
    	Not possible for EC2 Domain

    Routing Policies:
    	Simple : can return more ips at a time
    	Weighted : type of load balancing. ( Id  + Ip + Weight % + Region )
    	Latency : type of geolocation lb. ( Id + Ip + Region )
    	Failover: Primary & Secondary records.
    	Geolocation: Based on the client location. Default -> if nothing ( from all geolocation records ) matches with the client location
    	GeoProximity: to shift the more traffic to specific region using bias value.
    	Ip Based: based on client Ip ( CIDR block )
    	Multi Value: Simple Routing + Health checks for each record. Only returns the healthy records from the list.

    	You can create domain on 3rd party and use our route 53 as a DNS service. Just update the ns records in 3rd party with the records mentioned in our aws host zone. you need to configure Route 53 as the authoritative DNS provider for your domain by updating the name servers in your GoDaddy account. These authoritative name servers are specified in the domain's DNS records and managed by the domain's DNS provider

    Health Checks:
    	to prevent the traffic to go through the failed instances.
    	from all global locations. If > 18% then healthy.
    	string match for first 5128 bytes.

    	Simple Health Check ( Resources health checks )
    		15 global health checkers
    	Calculated Health Check : childs and parents
    	Private Health Check : based on cloud watch ( for private instances )

    how the ingress is going to create the record in exactly perticuler zone ?

CloudFront:

    216 edge locations
    origins: s3 bucket / custom origin ( ec2, load balancer, s3 website )
    cloudfront vs s3 cross region replication  [ static x dynamic ]
    Geo restriction : allow list and block list
    Price classes => Reduce the edge locations
    cache invalidation

Global Accelerator:

    create instnaces in different regions
    create endpoints with those instances
    attach those endpoints to the global accelerator
    global accelerator will expose 2 static IP's
    traffic will goes to the nearest region instance
    failover within 30 sec
    tcp, udp => good for gaming apps

S3:

    by default private, can't access using public url only through pre-signed url
    5TB, > 5GB ( multi upload )
    website hosting:

    	resource policy instead of user policy
    Performance: per prefix
        3,500 - GET/HEAD
        5,500 - PUT/POST/DELETE
    Uploads:
    	Multi uploads => can be paralellized
    	S3 tranfer acceleration => send it to nearest edge location ( public ) then use private network to upload.
    S3 byte-range fetches:
    	retrieve only partial data
    	can be parallelized
    S3 select & Glacier select
    	server-side-filtering instead of client side
    	less network & less cpu on client side

    	s3 will get csv file then it will filter the data then return only filtered data instead of sending all.
    S3 batch operations:
    	a job with list of objects + action to perform on those + optional parameters
    	like: encrypt all objects, update metadata, invoke lambda to perform something.

    Encryption:
    	server side:
    		default, kms, customer_key
    		api call limitations with kms key.
    	client side:
    		https is mandatory

    	kms limits on api calls for Decrypt + GenerateDataKey API calls

    policy usages:
    	force encryption while uploading by adding condition in policy
    	force use only https

    Allow CORS from another bucket to allow the first s3 bucket host. ( preflight request & response for methods )

    MFA Delete protection
    S3 access logs to another bucket
    Pre-signed url
    	for authorization => the permissions will be similer to the one who created that pre-signed url.
    	expiration: console (12H), cli (7D)
    Glacier vault lock & S3 object lock  =>
    	write once read many
    	Retention mode - compliance, governance
    	retention period
    	legal hold: hold the object regardless of retention
    Access Point
    	dns name + access permission
    	different folders => different access points => different users
    	access point + vpc endpoint ( restrict access from within vpc )
    S3 Object lambda
    	modifying data on fly before retrieval
    	s3 object => access point => lambda => lambda access point => application

Data Migrations:

    DMS ( an ec2 instance with CDC which is used to replicate the data  )
    SCT ( only when migrating to different engine )
    need an compute-intensive ec2 instance to run DMS + SCT
    DMS multi-az ( standby )
    RDS & Aurora migrations:
        Internal:
            1. snapshot from RDS and create Aurora DB
            2. Aurora read replica of RDS and promote it as primary
        External:
            create backup file
            upload to s3
            create db with s3 backup file
        If both are up and running DMS is best suite.

Mock Test Reviews:

    Use AWS Global Accelerator to distribute a portion of traffic to a particular deployment.
    In blue/green deployment if you wanna test the deployment without thinking about DNS cache, then use Global Accelerator.
    lowest latency and provide fast regional failover -> Global Accelerator

    AWS Compute Optimizer to look at instance type recommendations

    You cannot use Transfer Acceleration to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different Regions using Amazon S3 console.
    S3 replication: S3 batch & S3 sync

    Can't modify Stadanrd queue to FIFO.Should create new FIFO / delete the stadard and convert it to FIFO.FIFO should have suffex as .fifo
    FIFO will have 3000 thoughput with batching, 300 without batching

    Use lambda layer for re-usable code. upto 5 layers in a function.

    With launch template you can provision capacity across multiple instance types, but not with launch configuration.

    Nat instance supports port forwarding & bastion server

    Use VPC sharing to share one or more subnets with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent organization from AWS Organizations

    DMS to migrate from s3 to KDS & databases to Redshift

    high volume of read traffic, reduce latency, and also downsize the instance size to cut costs => ElasticCache ( not read replicas, cost matters )

    Fsx luster ->
        worlds most high performance file system. designed for applications that require fast storage
        can integrate with s3 and FSx for Lustre file system transparently presents S3 objects as files and allows you to write changed data back to S3.

    user data -> first time at launch, root user.

    Redshift spectrum -> s3 data

    Aws config -> imported certificate expiry notification

    Direct Connect:
        DTI - free
        DTO - going to outside aws will be changed but transfer to inside aws won't be charged

    Throttling is the process of limiting the number of requests an authorized program can submit to a given operation in a given amount of time. API Gateway will provide this

    If you specify targets using an instance ID, traffic is routed to instances using the primary private IP address specified in the primary network interface for the instance
    If you specify targets using IP addresses, you can route traffic to an instance using any private IP address from one or more network interfaces

    Compute Optimizer -> EC2,ASG,EBS,Lambda

    dead-letter queue to collect failed messages
    AWS recommend using separate queues when you need to provide prioritization of work

    Amazon RDS creates an SSL certificate and installs the certificate on the DB instance when Amazon RDS provisions the instance.

    OriginGroup -> An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a second origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify.

    tightly-coupled High Performance Computing -> Elastic Fabric Adapter

    two regions lo low latency queries annadante inka global db eh ( dynamodb, aurora )

    block protocols -> iscsi -> volume gateway (cache )
    file protocols -> nfs  -> file gateway ( cache )

    migrating to s3 / efs / fsx then first think about DataSync then only DMS
    AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) is used for migrating databases, not data on file shares.

    Lambda@Edge is not used to direct traffic to on-premises origins.

    Availability for on-premise database -> migrate to RDS multi-az

    task_role -> s3 , dynamodb access
    task_execution_role -> access to pull image, send logs
    container_instance_role -> to the entire ec2 instance ( means all tasks under instance )

    On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration

    maximum performance -> use Direct connect over site-to-site connection

    Mock-Test-1:
        mistake - multi az rds & ec2
        mistake - sqs over kds
        don't know - rds ssl
        mistake - backup with support details using cloudfront
        don't know - cloudfront origin group ( availability of origin )
        mistake - cloudfront to block countries
        mistake - hibernate the instance for instance memory preservation
        mistake - storage must be mounted using the NFS protocol ( EFS , not s3)
        mistake - cache for block & efs file storages (volume gateway, file gateway)
        mistake - notification service with decouple functionality ( SNS )
        mistake - migration from fsx to s3 ( datasync over dms )
        don't know - improve performance of on-premise dynamic app by having cache using cloudfront
        mistake - multi az ( mq,ec2,database )
        don't kmow - use deny over the allow as much as possible ( SCP with a deny rule that denies all but the specific instance types )
        mistake - scale middle tier ec2 instances
        don't know - ec2 when we need it ( capacity reservations(without commitment), zonal reserved instances(with commitment) )
        mistake - made ec2 instance available to internet ( use alb with new public subnets )
        mistake - maximum performance while connecting on-premise to vpc -> Direct connect over site-to-site
        don't know - AWS recommend using separate queues when you need to provide prioritization of work
        mistake - didn't understood it properly at that time. encrypt of read-replica only possible with new encrypted snapshot and new db creation.

    Mock Test - 2:
        private connection -> damn sure not SiteToSite connection. either snow family / direct connect ( if time permits )
        millisecond responsiveness  -> DynamoDb over Redshift
        near real-time performance  -> KDS over SQS
        durable and loosely coupled solution for storing jobs  -> SQS
        resilient storage for Windows instances -> Fsx windows server
        block HTTP or HTTPS traffic to domains -> domain list rules in network firewall
        AWS Batch is designed to run jobs across multiple instances
        NLB should be in the service provider VPC & Endpoint should be in the consumer VPC
        AWS recommend you use target tracking in place of step scaling for most use cases
        Amazon ECS uses the AWS Application Auto Scaling service to scales tasks. This is configured through Amazon ECS using Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling.
        Redshift -> RedShift can also improve performance for repeat queries by caching the result and returning the cached result when queries are re-run.
        hybrid cloud storage -> services that provide on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage -> Storagete gateway
        Accounts can be migrated between organizations using AWS Organizations console.

    Mock Test - 3:
        DNS failover configurations:
            active-passive -> failover
            active-active -> return many
            combination -> use more policies
        Encryption to Direct connect connection -> VPG
            A VPG is used to setup an AWS VPN which you can use in combination with Direct Connect to encrypt all data that traverses the Direct Connect link.
            This combination provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection that also reduces network costs, increases bandwidth throughput
        RDS -> KMS uses a customer master key (CMK) to encrypt the DB instance, all logs, backups, and snapshots.
        Multi-AZ RDS Read Replica -> create standby replica for your read replica. when availability matters for read replica regardless of whether the main instance is multi-az
        FSx for Windows File Server does not use Amazon S3
        API Gateway REST API directly accesses the data in the DynamoDB table
        Route 53 health check to route traffic to standby alb
        resilient architecture -> ASG + ALB
        static ip -> global accelerator since cloudfront won't work here.
        Aurora Multi master only works within a Region it does not work across Regions.
        S3 Replication -> Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
        If multi-az is available no need to create read replica, use the standby replica for read queries.
        It is not supported to connect Fargate to FSx for Lustre.

    Mock-Test-4
        cloudwatch event rule -> sns
        install Linux-based software application -> ec2, not lambda
        aws:Secure Transport header  -> SSL/TLS
        x-amz-server-side-encryption -> encrypt an object at the time of upload
        RAID-0 : I/O matters then fault tolerance
        RAID-1: fault tolerance matter then I/O
        Ec2 monitoring:
            basic monitoring -> 5 mins periods ( enabled by default )
            detailed monitoring -> 1 min periods
        AWS Data Exchange -> get third-party telemetry data
        AWS Private 5G -> scale your own private cellular network
        management account - enable organization trails option while creating new trail, members don't have write permissions on trials, read permissions on s3 logs.
        AWS License Manager -> manage the software licenses

                Replication:
                    Synchronous: A transaction can’t be acknowledged before all replicas have performed the write. it is not recommended to maintain many synchronous replicas
                    Asynchronous replication:  decouples the primary node from its replicas at the expense of introducing replication lag.
                    Quorum-based replication: combines synchronous and asynchronous replication
